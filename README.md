# Book Recommendation System - Data Analysis

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Book Recommendation System project. In this project, the objective is to generate features from the Book-Crossing dataset and use them to recommend books to users based on their preferences. The dataset consists of three files: Users, Books, and Ratings.

## Business Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a book recommendation system that suggests books to users based on their preferences. By analyzing the dataset, we can generate features that capture user-book interactions and utilize them to make personalized recommendations. This system aims to enhance user engagement and satisfaction by providing relevant book suggestions.

## Dataset Overview

The Book-Crossing dataset consists of the following files:

1. Users: Contains anonymized user IDs and demographic information such as location and age. Some fields may contain NULL-values if the information is unavailable.

2. Books: Identified by their respective ISBNs, this file includes book details such as title, author, publication year, and publisher. Amazon Web Services provided some content-based information. Additionally, URLs linking to cover images are given in small, medium, and large sizes.

3. Ratings: Contains book rating information. Ratings are expressed on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher values indicating higher appreciation. Implicit ratings are denoted by 0.

## Approach

To build the book recommendation system, we will follow these steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform the dataset to handle missing values, invalid ISBNs, and other inconsistencies.

2. Feature Generation: Extract relevant features from the dataset that capture user-book interactions, such as user preferences, book popularity, and similarity metrics.

3. Recommendation Algorithms: Apply collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithms to generate book recommendations for users based on their preferences.

4. Evaluation: Measure the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and accuracy.

5. Deployment: Implement the recommendation system in a user-friendly interface, allowing users to receive personalized book recommendations and explore the suggested books.

## Tools Used

The following tools and technologies are used for this project:

- Python: Programming language used for data preprocessing, feature generation, and recommendation algorithms.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: Library for machine learning tasks and recommendation algorithms.
- Flask: Web framework used for deploying the recommendation system.

## How to Use the Recommendation System

To use the book recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. Download the Book-Crossing dataset files (Users, Books, Ratings).
2. Preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, invalid ISBNs, and other inconsistencies.
3. Generate features from the dataset that capture user-book interactions.
4. Apply the recommendation algorithm of choice to generate personalized book recommendations for users.
5. Deploy the recommendation system using Flask or any other suitable web framework.
6. Provide a user-friendly interface where users can input their preferences and receive book recommendations based on their interests.
